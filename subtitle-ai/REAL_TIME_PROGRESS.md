# Real-Time Progress Tracking for Premium Translation

## Overview

The premium translation service now features real-time progress tracking that shows users exactly what's happening during the translation process. Users can see each phase of the research-based translation system as it happens.

## How It Works

### 1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/translate-progress?sessionId={sessionId}`
- **Real-time updates** sent from server to client
- **Automatic cleanup** when translation completes or fails

### 2. Progress Phases Displayed

When users select **Premium Context AI** service, they will see:

#### 🚀 **Initializing (0%)**
- "Starting translation process..."
- Setting up translation environment

#### 📁 **Analyzing File (10%)**
- "Analyzing filename and extracting show information..."
- Parsing filename patterns (e.g., `Naruto.S01E01.srt` → "Naruto")

#### 🔍 **Researching Content (20-40%)**
- "Researching '[Show Name]' for contextual information..."
- AI conducting comprehensive research about the show/movie
- Gathering genre, characters, cultural context, translation guidelines

#### 📊 **Analyzing Subtitles (40-50%)**
- "Analyzing subtitle content and themes..."
- Combining research data with subtitle content analysis

#### 🌐 **Translating (50-90%)**
- "Translating batch X/Y..." 
- Context-aware translation using research data
- Progress updates for each batch

#### ✨ **Finalizing (95-100%)**
- "Finalizing translation and quality checks..."
- Final processing and validation

## Visual Components

### Progress Indicators
- **Overall progress bar** with percentage
- **Stage-by-stage visualization** with icons
- **Active stage highlighting** with animated dots
- **Completed stages** marked with green checkmarks
- **Current stage details** with descriptive text

### Error Handling
- **Red error indicators** if translation fails
- **Specific error messages** for troubleshooting
- **Graceful fallback** to regular progress display

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React)
```typescript
// Hook for progress management
const { 
  progress, 
  startProgress, 
  updateProgress, 
  completeProgress, 
  errorProgress 
} = useTranslationProgress()

// Server-Sent Events connection
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/translate-progress?sessionId=${sessionId}`)
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
  if (data.type === 'progress') {
    updateProgress(data.stage, data.progress, data.details)
  }
}
```

### Backend (API)
```typescript
// Progress callback in translation service
const progressCallback = (stage: string, progress: number, details?: string) => {
  updateTranslationProgress(sessionId, stage, progress, details)
}

// Called during translation phases
progressCallback('researching', 30, 'Researching "Naruto" for contextual information...')
```

## User Experience

### Before (Old System)
- Generic "Translating with Premium Context AI..." message
- Simple progress bar with no context
- No visibility into what's happening

### After (New System)
- **Detailed phase descriptions** showing exactly what's happening
- **Visual progress through 6 distinct stages**
- **Real-time updates** as each phase completes
- **Professional appearance** with animated indicators
- **Error transparency** with specific failure messages

## Testing

### Demo Mode (No API Key)
- All phases are simulated with realistic timing
- Shows complete progress flow
- Demonstrates visual components

### Production Mode (With API Key)
- Real AI research and translation
- Actual progress tracking from backend
- True real-time updates

## File Examples

Test with these filename patterns to see research in action:

- `Naruto.S01E01.srt` → Research about Naruto anime
- `Wednesday.S01E05.srt` → Research about Wednesday Addams series  
- `Attack.on.Titan.Episode.01.srt` → Research about Attack on Titan
- `The.Matrix.(1999).srt` → Research about The Matrix movie

## Benefits

1. **Transparency** - Users see exactly what's happening
2. **Professional Feel** - Advanced progress visualization
3. **Trust Building** - Shows the complexity of the AI system
4. **Better UX** - No more wondering if the system is working
5. **Educational** - Users learn about the translation process
6. **Error Clarity** - Specific failure points identified

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers** with EventSource support
- **Automatic fallback** to polling if SSE fails
- **Mobile responsive** progress indicators
- **Accessibility** features for screen readers
