# Email Verification System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Email verification system has been successfully implemented to prevent spam registrations and ensure users have valid email addresses before accessing translation features.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Authentication System Updates**
- **File**: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Added `sendEmailVerification` import from Firebase Auth
- Added `sendVerificationEmail()` function to resend verification emails
- Updated `signUp()` to automatically send verification email after registration
- Updated `signInWithGoogle()` to handle Google users (they're automatically verified)

### 2. **Email Verification Page**
- **File**: `src/app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx`
- Complete verification page with:
  - Email verification status display
  - Resend verification email functionality
  - Check verification status button
  - User-friendly error handling
  - Automatic redirect when verified

### 3. **Registration Form Updates**
- **File**: `src/components/forms/register-form.tsx`
- Updated success message to inform about email verification
- Redirects to `/verify-email` instead of dashboard after registration
- Added Mail icon import

### 4. **Email Verification Guard Component**
- **File**: `src/components/auth/email-verification-guard.tsx`
- Protects pages that require verified email
- Shows verification required message with clear instructions
- Supports optional verification (can be disabled for certain pages)
- Higher-order component wrapper available

### 5. **Protected Pages**
All translation and dashboard pages now require email verification:
- `/translate` (both single and batch modes)
- `/cs/translate` (Czech version)
- `/dashboard`
- `/cs/dashboard`

### 6. **API Protection**
- **File**: `src/app/api/translate/route.ts`
- **File**: `src/app/api/batch/save-translation/route.ts`
- Added email verification checks before allowing translation
- Returns specific error code `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` for frontend handling

### 7. **Database Updates**
- **File**: `src/lib/database.ts`
- Updated user creation to set `emailVerified: false` by default
- Added comment explaining verification requirement

## 🔧 How It Works

### Registration Flow:
1. User registers with email/password
2. Firebase automatically sends verification email
3. User profile created with `emailVerified: false`
4. User redirected to `/verify-email` page
5. User must click link in email to verify
6. After verification, user can access all features

### Google Sign-In Flow:
1. User signs in with Google
2. Google users are automatically verified
3. User can immediately access all features

### Protection Flow:
1. User tries to access protected page/feature
2. `EmailVerificationGuard` checks verification status
3. If not verified, shows verification required message
4. If verified, allows access to feature

## 🎨 User Experience

### Verification Required Screen:
- Clear explanation of why verification is needed
- Shows user's email address
- "Verify Email Address" button
- "Resend Verification Email" functionality
- Success/error messages for resend attempts

### API Error Handling:
- Translation APIs return specific error codes
- Frontend can handle `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` errors
- User-friendly error messages in Czech and English

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

1. **Spam Prevention**: Bots cannot easily create accounts without email access
2. **Valid Email Verification**: Ensures users own their email addresses
3. **Account Security**: Prevents unauthorized account creation
4. **Compliance**: Follows email verification best practices

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Email Verification:
1. Register new account with email/password
2. Check email for verification link
3. Try accessing `/translate` before verification (should be blocked)
4. Click verification link in email
5. Try accessing `/translate` after verification (should work)

### Test Resend Functionality:
1. Register new account
2. Go to `/verify-email` page
3. Click "Resend Verification Email"
4. Check for new email
5. Verify success message appears

### Test Google Sign-In:
1. Sign in with Google account
2. Should immediately have access to all features
3. No verification required for Google users

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Email Templates**: Custom branded verification emails
2. **Verification Expiry**: Time-limited verification links
3. **Email Change**: Allow users to change email with re-verification
4. **Admin Override**: Admin ability to manually verify users
5. **Verification Reminders**: Periodic reminder emails

### Configuration Options:
1. **Feature Flag**: Ability to disable verification for testing
2. **Grace Period**: Allow limited access before verification
3. **Verification Bypass**: For specific user roles or domains

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables:
No additional environment variables needed - uses existing Firebase configuration.

### Firebase Settings:
Ensure Firebase Auth email verification is enabled in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Authentication > Templates
2. Customize email verification template if desired
3. Ensure email verification is enabled

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Before Deployment:
1. Test email delivery in production environment
2. Verify Firebase email templates are configured
3. Test with real email addresses
4. Ensure SMTP settings are correct in Firebase

### After Deployment:
1. Monitor verification rates
2. Check for email delivery issues
3. Monitor user feedback about verification process
4. Track spam reduction metrics
